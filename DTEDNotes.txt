You should be linking GDAL Jar to your environment manually:
To do this,
Open Project Structure in IDEA
Select Modules
On the right hand side there are 3 tabs: Sources,Paths,Dependencies
Selected dependencies
Click + add button and select add Jar
Browse your working GDAL folder in your computer:
C:\Program Files\GDAL\java\gdal.jar (this is version 2.2.3)
Add this jar to the list AND Using Move Up promote this jar file to the top just below Maven..:hamcrest...

Not: There is already Maven:org.gdal:gdal:2.2.0 in the list toward the end of the list. According to my experience 
no need to remove this dependency, DTED example continues to run as long as our our gdal jar is at the top.
